# LLM Cost-Aware Routing Gateway

An OpenAI-compatible proxy that routes each request to the cheapest model that can
handle it, falls back when a provider misbehaves, and records what every request costs.

Full design lives in [knowledge/architecture.md](knowledge/architecture.md) — read it
before making non-trivial routing, storage, or dashboard decisions.

## Status

**Design stage — no application code exists yet.** The repo currently holds this
`.claude/` guidance and the architecture spec. Build order is the roadmap below.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| API | FastAPI + Uvicorn (async) |
| Routing | YAML rules (stage 1) + cheap-model classifier (stage 2) |
| Storage | SQLite in WAL mode |
| Dashboard | Server-rendered HTML (no build step) |
| Config | Mounted `config.yaml` (rules, pools, classifier, price table) |
| Deploy | Docker Compose on a VPS behind an existing reverse proxy |

## Intended repo layout

Follow the FastAPI structure skill (see below), adapted for this gateway:

```

## Working in this repo

- **Read the rules before writing code:** [rules/domain-invariants.md](rules/domain-invariants.md)
  (behaviors that must not regress) and [rules/engineering.md](rules/engineering.md)
  (how to write the code).
- **Conventions come from skills**, not copied prose. Invoke them via the Skill tool:
  - `fastapi-template` — project structure, async, DI, testing setup.
  - `python-design-patterns` — KISS, SRP, composition, rule of three, layering.
- **Keep V1 scope tight.** Anything in the "Deferred" table of the architecture doc is
  out of scope — don't build it without a decision to move it in.
- **Build features through the workflow.** Run `/workflow <task>` to drive the isolated
  plan → code → test → review loop instead of coding ad hoc. See
  [knowledge/workflow.md](knowledge/workflow.md).

## Commands

> Intended once code lands — no build system exists yet. Update this section when it does.

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload      # run the gateway locally
pytest                             # run the test suite
docker compose up                  # run as deployed (SQLite volume + reverse proxy)
```

## Build order (roadmap)

| Milestone | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | Passthrough proxy + static key + SQLite request logging | ✅ done (merged to `main`) |
| M2 | YAML rule engine + pools + cost table | ✅ done (merged to `main`) |
| M3 | Fallback chain + 60s cooldown | ✅ done (merged to `main`) |
| M4 | Classifier stage + routing-reason capture | ✅ done (merged to `main`) |
| M5 | Dashboard | next |
| M6 | VPS deploy, first real workload cut over | |

## Autonomous milestone execution

The owner has authorized building the roadmap **autonomously, without pausing for
approval between milestones**. On any session, drive the roadmap like this:

1. Take the next milestone whose Status is not `done` and run it through `/workflow`
   (plan → code → test → review), exactly as M1 was built.
2. When the review gate returns **APPROVE** and the full suite passes, **merge the
   milestone branch into `main`** (`--no-ff`, milestone message), mark it `done` in the
   table above, and **immediately start the next milestone** — do not stop to ask.
3. Keep the same env-var-for-secrets and scope-guard decisions already made; do not
   pull anything from the architecture doc's **Deferred** table into scope.
4. **Do stop and ask** only when a stage hits a genuinely blocking decision that is the
   owner's to make (a new external dependency, a schema/contract choice not implied by
   the spec, or anything irreversible/outward-facing such as `git push`, deploying, or
   spending against a real provider key). Note the decision, don't guess past it.
5. Never `git push`, deploy (M6), or hit real provider APIs without explicit go-ahead —
   local merges to `main` are fine; anything leaving the machine is not.

Stop autonomous execution when M5 is merged (M6 is a deploy gate that needs the owner).
